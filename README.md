# Danware
Spectroscopy tool developed for people who don't like root.
Honestly it's all very easy. 

'q' at most times will quit - else use 'ctrl' + 'z'.

I made this primarily as a challenge - recreating many of the utilities that root provides but in a more controlled enviroment.

This is made with the PyROOT module - for this to work you must have ROOT installed and PyROOT enabled. If you want actually useful programs you can look for Grutinzer or Radware.

Honestly, this is best for converting from '.CNF' to '.root' etc. and it is able to display a 1D histogram and (kinda) project a matrix between specific bounds onto the x-axis.
